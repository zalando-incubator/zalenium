> **Thanks for open sourcing this. Our test suite run time has dropped from more than an hour to six minutes.** â€” [@TKueck](https://twitter.com/Tkueck/status/887425829273088000)

We know how complicated it is to:
* Have a stable grid to run UI tests with Selenium
* Maintain it over time (keep up with new browser, Selenium and drivers versions)
* Provide capabilities to cover all browsers and platforms

That is why we took this approach where <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium"><u>docker-selenium</u></a>
nodes are created on demand. Your UI tests run faster in Firefox and Chrome because they are running in your own local network,
on a node created from scratch and disposed after the test completes.

If you need a capability that cannot be fulfilled by [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium),
the test gets redirected to a cloud testing provider (<a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/"><u>Sauce Labs</u></a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browserstack.com/"><u>BrowserStack</u></a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://testingbot.com/"><u>TestingBot</u></a>).

**Zalenium's main goal is: to allow anyone to have a disposable and flexible Selenium Grid infrastructure.**

Part of the idea comes from this <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/introducing-the-sauce-plugin-for-selenium-grid"><u>Sauce Labs post</u></a>.

### What does **Zalenium** mean?
As you can imagine, it is the result of mixing _<a target="_blank" href="https://tech.zalando.com"><u>Zalando</u></a>_ 
and _<a target="_blank" href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/"><u>Selenium</u></a>_. As mentioned before, this project's aim 
is to provide a simple way to create a grid and contribute to the Selenium community.
Nevertheless, this is _**not**_ an official <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/"><u>Selenium</u></a> 
project. We kindly ask you to post <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zalando/zalenium/issues/new"><u>issues</u></a> 
or <a target="_blank" href="https://gitter.im/zalando/zalenium"><u>questions</u></a> through the channels we created for that.
