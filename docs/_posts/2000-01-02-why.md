> **Thanks for open sourcing this. Our test suite run time has dropped from more than an hour to six minutes.** â€” [@TKueck](https://twitter.com/Tkueck/status/887425829273088000)

We know how complicated it is to:
* Have a stable grid to run UI tests with Selenium
* Maintain it over time (keep up with new browser, Selenium and drivers versions)
* Provide capabilities to cover all browsers and platforms

That is why we took this approach where [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) nodes are
created on demand. Your UI tests run faster in Firefox and Chrome because they are running in your own local network,
on a node created from scratch and disposed after the test completes.

If you need a capability that cannot be fulfilled by [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium),
the test gets redirected to a cloud testing provider ([Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/),
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/)).

**Zalenium's main goal is: to allow anyone to have a disposable and flexible Selenium Grid infrastructure.**

Part of the idea comes from this [Sauce Labs post](https://saucelabs.com/blog/introducing-the-sauce-plugin-for-selenium-grid).

### What does **Zalenium** mean?
As you can imagine, it is the result of mixing _[Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com)_ and _[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)_.
As mentioned before, this project's aim is to provide a simple way to create a grid and contribute to the Selenium community.
Nevertheless, this is _**not**_ an official [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) project. We kindly ask you to post
[issues](https://github.com/zalando/zalenium/issues/new) or [questions](https://gitter.im/zalando/zalenium) through the
channels we created for that.
