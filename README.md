# :exclamation: Current project status: Looking for active maintainers
### Zalenium is currently on maintenance mode, no new features are being implemented and bugs are fixed via PRs sent by community. The current maintainers only have time to review PRs and do releases. 
### Additionally, due to the changes being implemented on the upstream Selenium Grid 4.x, it is unlikely that Zalenium can be upgraded with the current resources. If this is to be achieved, more active maintainers are needed.
### If you are interested in supporting the project, please create a GitHub issue expressing your interest.

This is a Selenium Grid extension to scale your local grid dynamically with docker containers. It uses
[docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) to run your tests in Firefox and Chrome locally, if you
need a different browser, your tests can get redirected to a cloud testing provider ([Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/), 
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/), [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/)). Zalenium also works out of the box
in [Kubernetes](https://zalando.github.io/zalenium/#kubernetes).

Zalenium's maintainers add new features regularly. We invite you to test it, report bugs, suggest any ideas you may
have, and contribute. See our [contributing guidelines](https://zalando.github.io/zalenium/#contributing) for more details.

### Why?

> Thanks for open sourcing this. Our test suite run time has dropped from more than an hour to six minutes. â€” [@TKueck](https://twitter.com/Tkueck/status/887425829273088000)

We know how complicated it is to:
* Have a stable grid to run UI tests with Selenium
* Maintain it over time (keep up with new browser, Selenium and drivers versions)
* Provide capabilities to cover all browsers and platforms

That is why we took this approach where [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) nodes are
created on demand. Your UI tests in Firefox and Chrome will run faster because they are running on a local grid,
on a node created from scratch and disposed after the test completes.

If you need a capability that cannot be fulfilled by [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium),
the test gets redirected to a cloud testing provider ([Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/),
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/), [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/)).

Zalenium's main goal is: to allow anyone to have a disposable and flexible Selenium Grid infrastructure.

Part of the idea comes from this [Sauce Labs post](https://saucelabs.com/blog/introducing-the-sauce-plugin-for-selenium-grid).

### What does **Zalenium** mean?
As you can imagine, it is the result of mixing _[Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com)_ and _[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)_.
As mentioned before, this project's aim is to provide a simple way to create a grid and contribute to the Selenium community.
Nevertheless, this is _**not**_ an official [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) project. We kindly ask you to create
[issues](https://github.com/zalando/zalenium/issues/new) in this repository. If you have questions about how to get
started, please join the #zalenium channel on [Slack](https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com).

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
* Docker engine running, version >= 1.11.1 (probably works with earlier versions, not tested yet).
* Make sure your docker daemon is running (e.g. `docker info` works without errors).

* Pull the [docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) image. `docker pull elgalu/selenium`

* `docker pull dosel/zalenium`

#### Run it
* Zalenium uses docker to scale on-demand, therefore we need to give it the `docker.sock` full access, this is known as
"Docker alongside docker".

  ```sh
   # Pull docker-selenium
    docker pull elgalu/selenium

    # Pull Zalenium
    docker pull dosel/zalenium
          
    docker run --rm -ti --name zalenium -p 4444:4444 \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v /tmp/videos:/home/seluser/videos \
      --privileged dosel/zalenium start
  ```

  * Why `--privileged`? We suggest you run Zalenium as `--privileged` to speed up the node registration process by
      increasing the entropy level with [Haveged](http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/). Using `--privileged` is optional
      since it is just meant to improve its performance. For more information, check this
      [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged).

* Try also our one line installer and starter for OSX/Linux (it will check for the latest images and ask for missing dependencies.)

  ```sh
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosel/t/i/p | bash -s start
  ```

* More usage examples, parameters, configurations, video usage and one line starters can be seen [here](https://zalando.github.io/zalenium/#usage)
* After the output, you can check the [grid](http://localhost:4444/grid/console) console
* Now you can point your Selenium tests to [http://localhost:4444/wd/hub](http://localhost:4444/wd/hub)
* Stop it: `docker stop zalenium`

## Additional features
* [Dashboard](http://localhost:4444/dashboard), see all the videos and aggregated logs after your tests completed.

* Live preview of your running tests [http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live](http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live)

* Video recording, check them in the `/tmp/videos` folder (or the one you mapped when starting Zalenium)
* Customise video file naming via capabilities, basic auth and [more](https://zalando.github.io/zalenium/#usage)
